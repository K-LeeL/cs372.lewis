// Assignment 06, Part 3: Testing the connection between binary search and binary search trees
// Due: Tue Oct 10, 2023 11:59pm
//
// File:   A6Part3.cpp
// Author: Kaylee Lewis

// Now use the binary search function from the first question plus the structure and the function
// that fills and sorts a vector of random integers from the second question to write a program that
// will compare the execution time of binary search vs. lookup times in a binary search tree.
// You program should generate one of the structures from the previous questions for arrays and trees with
// 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000,and 50,000 elements. After creating the array it should pick 100 numbers at random
// and search for each number first in the structure’s array and then search for the same number using the BST,
// keeping track of the times in each case (use the chrono library, as was done in the code from the Towers of Annoy...
// I mean "Towers of Hanoi"... assignment).
// Compute and report the average times for both types of search for each of the array/tree sizes.
