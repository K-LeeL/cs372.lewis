// File:   assignment4part1.cpp
// Author: Kaylee Lewis
//
// Purpose: Josepheus program using list, stack, and queue

#include "Header.h"
#include <iostream>

// was curious why it was called Josephus: fun but dark video on the origin of the math behind the pogram https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCsD3ZGzMgE ( its a lot nicer to think about it as hot potato)

//Priority queue and lists : Josephus, m people, last one standing is the winner.

template <typename T>
public class Josephus {
  public static List(int n, int m);

  // Priority queue 1 to N people sit in a circle

  List<int> circle;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    // circle
    circle.push.back(i);
  }

  // begin the game, looking for who is it
  auto it = circle.begin();

  // circle around passing the hot potato

  // Eliminate the holder of the hot potato

  // last one wins
}
