// Assignment 05: Part 4: Pruning a tree
// Due: Tue 10/3/2023
//
// File:   A54Part4.cpp
// Author: Kaylee Lewis

// This is an exercise in recursion: Write a standalone function (that is, a
// function that is not a method function of the tree class),  that when given a
// reference to a tree, returns a reference to a new tree that is almost a copy
// of the original tree except the new tree contains none of the leaves of the
// original tree.
