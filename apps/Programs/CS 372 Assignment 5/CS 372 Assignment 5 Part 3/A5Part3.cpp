// We need to delete a node from a tree.  We provided the algorithm to do this
// in the lecture notes.   Implement this algorithm by adding a new method named
// delete to the tree class.   This function should take one parameter, the
// value stored in the node to be deleted passed as reference parameter.   If
// the method finds a node containing that value in the tree, delete it and
// return true.  Otherwise, return false to indicate the value was not found in
// the tree.
