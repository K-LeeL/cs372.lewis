// Assignment 05, Part 1: An Exercise In the Use of Smart Pointers
// Due: Tue 10/3/2023
//
// File:   A54Part1.cpp
// Author: Kaylee Lewis

// Refactor the `List` class in your class library to use smart pointers
// instead of raw pointers. You will need to adjust the memory allocation and
// deallocation of nodes appropriately.
// Update your test cases and regression test the changes (i.e., make certain
// to run all tests),
